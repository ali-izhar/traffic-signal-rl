# Adaptive Traffic Signal Control using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project develops an intelligent traffic signal control system using advanced reinforcement learning techniques. By applying multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithms, we aim to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve urban mobility.

## Features
- Multiple RL algorithms implementation
- Adaptive traffic signal control
- Multi-intersection coordination
- Detailed performance visualization
- Comparative analysis of different approaches
